"""Authorship provenance — keep the author's own sentences, and prove it.

ContentForge's normal mode writes from research. This script supports the other
mode: the client brings their own rough draft — a voice-note transcript, a wall
of bullets, ugly stream-of-consciousness — and the pipeline develops it AROUND
their sentences instead of paraphrasing them away.

Why it exists (the honest version): a client's own words are the one part of a
piece that is genuinely, unambiguously theirs. Paraphrasing them is the single
most common way an AI pipeline quietly launders a human voice out of a document
— the author reads the output, recognizes their idea, and no longer recognizes a
single sentence. This script measures whether that happened.

It reports three things a human editor actually needs:
  1. which sentences in the final draft are the author's, verbatim;
  2. which of the author's sentences were REWRITTEN (a broken promise);
  3. which of the author's sentences were DROPPED entirely.

Unlike the AI-tell scans, findings 2 and 3 are not advisory. A detector score is
probabilistic and deserves hedging; "the author wrote this sentence and it is no
longer here" is a fact. Those exit non-zero.

This is not a detector-evasion tool and carries no target ratio to hit. There is
no threshold at which text becomes "human enough" — the ratio is reported so the
disclosure can be accurate, never so a score can be gamed. It measures visible
text only, and has no relationship to any statistical watermark.

Usage:
    python authorship.py --source notes.md --draft phase-6.5-humanized.md
    python authorship.py --source notes.md --draft draft.md --out authorship.json
