If the file is NOT content deliverable (article, blog, whitepaper, FAQ, research paper) and is NOT inside the ContentForge plugin directory, respond 'SKIP' immediately. Only proceed if this IS content being generated by ContentForge. If it is content: (1) Scan for hallucination indicators: statistics/percentages without source attribution, URLs with placeholder patterns (example.com, your-site.com, placeholder URLs), superlative claims ('best', '#1', 'leading') without substantiation, specific citations to studies or named sources that could be fabricated. (2) Flag any found with severity CRITICAL (for fabricated stats/URLs in headlines/CTAs) or WARNING (for unattributed claims in body text). (3) Include the specific text and a fix suggestion (add citation, remove claim, or use 'according to [verifiable source]'). Keep the check concise — flag only real hallucination risks. $ARGUMENTS"
